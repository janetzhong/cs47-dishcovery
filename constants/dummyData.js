And when, in the case of bacalao, the fish is rehydrated and cooked, the result is tender and delicious. In Mexico, the ingredients to make theBacalao a la Mexicana include tomatoes, ancho chiles, onions, cinnamon, potato and olives. It’s filling and it certainly warms you up!",

Because about 3.6 million Japanese families eat KFC on Christmas Eve, they often need to reserve their meal up to two months in advance. During the 1970s, KFC put together a holiday party bucket and behind it, a brilliant marketing plan. At the time, Japan didn’t have many Christmas traditions. KFC filled that void by telling consumers “here is something that you should do on Christmas”. The trend caught on quickly.",
